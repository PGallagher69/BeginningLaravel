# Setup for a Vagrant based installation (Step 9):

## Launch the Vagrant Box:

  1. In the Command Prompt and navigate to your Homestead Directory, replacing the [**_LaravelDirectory_**] with the directory you chose to create at [Step 5](vagrant-5.md), e.g.;

```
c:\[LaravelDirectory]\Homestead
```

  2. Provision and run your Laravel Homestead Vagrant Box using the following command;

```
vagrant up
```

  3. If you encounter a &quot;_hardening_&quot; error, make sure all Virus Scanners (including Rapport) are disabled.
