# Laravel Instructions (Step 14):

## Create the View for the new Controller:

1. Open VS Code.
2. Find the following folder;

```
resources\views
```
3. Add a new folder in the "_Views_" folder called [**_controllername_**], replacing [**_controllername_**] with the lowercase name of the Controller you created at [Step 10](laravel-10.md), so;

```
resources\views\[controllername]
```

4. Right click on the "_dashboard.blade.php_" file and click "_Copy_".
5. Right click on the new [**_controllername_**] folder and paste a copy of the file here, replacing [**_controllername_**] with the lowercase name of the Controller you created at [Step 10](laravel-10.md).
6. Rename the file to "_index.blade.php_".
7. You should have a structure as follows, replacing [**_controllername_**] with the lowercase name of the Controller you created at [Step 10](laravel-10.md);

```
resources\views\[controllername]\index.blade.php
```
